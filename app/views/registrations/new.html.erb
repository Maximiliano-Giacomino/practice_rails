<%# The above syntax allows us to create forms thru Ruby. The form_with line looks for a URL based in our model, so it'll parse our routes.rb file looking for a URL named "Users". Since this would lead to our routes file getting confusing (we'd rather have a "get sign_up" and a "post sign_up" lines instead of a users one in there) we add the "url: <>" tag to point it to a specific route WE name ourselves. The same URL can handle multiple types of requests and that is how we want our site to be setup %>
<%# There are automatic messages in forms for every type of error, but they are in english and thus not useful for us. They only work in forms that use "model:", as the errors are saved within the model we create and are pertinent to each of them.%>
