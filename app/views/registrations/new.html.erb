<h1>Sign Up</h1>

<%= form_with model: @user, url: sign_up_path do |form| %>
<%=     form.text_field :email%>
<%=     form.password_field :password%>
<%=     form.password_field :password_confirmation%>
<% end %>
<%# The above syntax allows us to create forms thru Ruby. The form_with line looks for a URL based in our model, so it'll parse our routes.rb file looking for a URL named "Users". Since this would lead to our routes file getting confusing (we'd rather have a "get sign_up" and a "post sign_up" lines instead of a users one in there) we add the "url: <>" tag to point it to a specific route WE name ourselves. The same URL can handle multiple types of requests and that is how we want our site to be setup %>
