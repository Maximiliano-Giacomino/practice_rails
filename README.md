# README

Practice repo for Ruby on Rails.

So far, using:

- Ruby version (3.4.2)

- Rails version (8.0.2)

- Bootstrap (5.3.6)

We've installed the most up-to-date version of these programs, but the course and guides we're following are for Rails 6 and we're working as though the newer features don't exist.
